# About me

Hey! I'm Meta. Surprisingly enough, I like to code stuff! And as you can see, I'm also a furry.

My main language is C# with .NET Core, although I do a lot of typescript/javascript too.
As you can see in my skill list, I tinkered around with some stuff in game development and music production aswell.
Originally, I started my career in Windows automation and software deployment, but I realised soon that programming is way cooler, so that's what I did.

Iâ€™m currently working on the backend of the mobile app for the Eurofurence, a furry convention.

When it comes to hobbies - apart from coding and furry stuff of course - I like gaming, movies/TV shows, reading and cooking.

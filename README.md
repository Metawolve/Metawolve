# About me

My main language is C# with .NET Core, although I do a lot of typescript/javascript too.
As you can see in my skill list, I tinkered around with some stuff in game development and music production aswell.
Originally, I started my career in Windows automation and software deployment, but I realised soon that programming is more my thing.

Iâ€™m currently working on the backend of the mobile app for the Eurofurence, a furry convention.

When it comes to hobbies, I like gaming, movies/TV shows, reading and cooking.
